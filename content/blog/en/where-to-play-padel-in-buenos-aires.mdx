## Tips for Choosing a Court in Buenos Aires

- **Location**: Prioritize courts near your area. Buenos Aires traffic can make it hard to arrive on time.
- **Schedule**: Peak hours (6-9pm) tend to have less availability. If you can play before 6pm or after 9pm, you'll find more options and better prices.
- **Surface**: Premium synthetic grass makes a noticeable difference in gameplay. Ask before booking.
- **Open courts vs. reservation**: If you're playing solo or as a pair, look for places with "open courts" where a coordinator sets up matches.

## Track Your Matches

Once you find your court, use [Padel Tracker](/tracker) to record every point, track detailed stats, and share results with your group.
