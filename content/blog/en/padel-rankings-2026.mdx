The 2025 Premier Padel season left a clear message: Arturo Coello and Agustín Tapia are the pair to beat. But 2026 kicks off with major changes across the circuit that could shake up the rankings. Let's break it down.

## Men's ranking: FIP Top 10

| # | Player | Points |
|---|--------|--------|
| 1 | Arturo Coello | 19,800 |
| 2 | Agustín Tapia | 19,800 |
| 3 | Alejandro Galán | 17,320 |
| 4 | Federico Chingotto | 17,320 |
| 5 | Franco Stupaczuk | 7,905 |
| 6 | Juan Lebrón | 7,845 |
| 7 | Jorge Nieto | 6,322 |
| 8 | Miguel Yanguas | 6,322 |
| 9 | Francisco Navarro | 6,115 |
| 10 | Leandro Augsburger | 5,155 |

The gap between the top two pairs and the rest is massive. Coello/Tapia closed 2025 with the Premier Padel Finals title in Barcelona, confirming their total dominance.

## Women's ranking: FIP Top 10

| # | Player | Points |
|---|--------|--------|
| 1 | Gemma Triay | 18,060 |
| 2 | Delfina Brea | 18,060 |
| 3 | Ariana Sánchez | 14,720 |
| 4 | Paula Josemaría | 14,720 |
| 5 | Claudia Fernández | 13,040 |
| 6 | Beatriz González | 13,040 |
| 7 | Sofía Araújo | 7,030 |
| 8 | Andrea Ustero Prieto | 6,625 |
| 9 | Marta Ortega | 6,435 |
| 10 | Tamara Icardo | 6,050 |

Triay and Brea dominated with consistency throughout the year. Behind them, Sánchez/Josemaría maintain pressure as the main challengers.

## The new pairs shaking up the rankings

The most interesting storyline of 2026 isn't the leaders — it's the changes behind them. Historic pairs have split:

**Lebrón / Augsburger** — Juan Lebrón left Stupaczuk and paired up with Argentine Leo Augsburger. The duo is still in its building phase, but Lebrón brings all his experience and intensity.

**Stupaczuk / Yanguas** — Franco found a hungry partner in Mike Yanguas. They start third in combined ranking (14,277 points) and could surprise.

**Coki Nieto / Jon Sanz** — Sanz split from Navarro to form this pair. They sit in the top 8 with 11,447 points.

**Paquito Navarro / Fran Guerrero** — Paquito keeps reinventing himself. With Guerrero, he's looking to compete at the top again.

**Momo González / Martín Di Nenno** — Argentine Di Nenno teams up with Momo to round out the top 8.

## What's ahead: 2026 Season

The 2026 calendar is the biggest in history: **26 tournaments across 18 countries**. It started in Riyadh (February) and ends with the Finals in Barcelona (December).

Key dates:
- **Miami P1** — March 23-29
- **Italy Major** — June 1-7 (Rome)
- **Paris Major** — September 7-13 (Roland Garros)
- **Barcelona Finals** — December 7-13

Emotional note: 2026 marks the final professional season for two legends — **Miguel Lamperti** and **Ale Salazar**.

## The question of the year

Will the reshuffling of pairs be enough to challenge Coello/Tapia and Galán/Chingotto? Or will they continue to set the pace like in 2025?

The numbers say the gap is wide. But professional padel has a way of surprising — on a fast surface, one inspired day can change everything.
