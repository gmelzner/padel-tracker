The backhand is one of the fundamental shots in padel. Unlike tennis, in padel the backhand is used constantly — from return of serve to defensive shots off the wall. Improving it can make a huge difference in your game.

## 1. Hand position on the grip

The continental grip is the most versatile for the backhand in padel. Keep the grip relaxed but firm, without squeezing too hard. A common mistake is switching grips between shots — practice until the continental becomes your natural position.

> 80% of backhand errors start with the grip. If your grip isn't right, the rest of the shot won't be either.

## 2. Early preparation

Don't wait for the ball to arrive before preparing your shot. As soon as you identify the ball is coming to your backhand:

- Rotate your shoulders to the left side (if you're right-handed)
- Bring the racket back with a slightly bent elbow
- Keep your legs semi-flexed with your weight on the balls of your feet

Early preparation gives you time to adjust and execute with control.

## 3. Contact point

The ideal contact point is **in front of your body**, at hip height. If you hit the ball too far back, you lose power and control. If you hit it too far forward, you lose accuracy.

Practice this drill: place a cone 30 cm in front of your lead foot. That's your ideal contact point.

## 4. Follow through

After contact, don't cut the movement short. Follow through with the racket toward your target. The follow through should be:

1. **Fluid** — no jerky movements
2. **Directed** — toward where you want the ball to go
3. **Complete** — finish with the racket at the height of your opposite shoulder

A good follow through improves both the direction and depth of your shots.

## 5. Use data to improve

This is where technology can give you an edge. Using [Padel Tracker](https://padeltracker.pro/tracker), you can log your matches and spot patterns in your game:

- **Winners vs unforced errors**: How many points do you win with your backhand vs how many do you lose?
- **Effectiveness by set**: Does your backhand deteriorate in the third set?
- **Trends**: Are you improving match over match?

Numbers don't lie. Track your matches and you'll have concrete data to know where to focus your practice.

## Conclusion

Improving your backhand doesn't happen overnight, but with consistent practice and attention to these five points, you'll notice the difference. Start with the grip, work on early preparation, and use data to measure your progress.
