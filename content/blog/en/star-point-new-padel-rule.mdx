Professional padel has a new rule that's already changing match dynamics. It's called the **Star Point**, and it's the scoring system that replaces the classic endless deuce format. Whether you play amateur or professional padel, you need to understand how it works.

## What is the Star Point?

The Star Point is a hybrid system between the **golden point** and **classic advantage**. It was unanimously approved at the FIP General Assembly (100 national federations) in November 2025 and has been officially implemented across all professional circuits since 2026.

The concept is straightforward: you play up to **two rounds of normal advantage**, and if nobody closes the game, the third deuce is settled by a **single decisive point** — the Star Point.

## How does it work step by step?

When the score reaches 40-40 (deuce), the Star Point activates in three phases:

### Phase 1 — First deuce
Normal advantage rules apply. The team that wins the point gets advantage. If they win the next point, they close the game. If they lose it, it's back to deuce.

### Phase 2 — Second deuce
Exactly the same as Phase 1. Normal advantage, with the chance to close or return to deuce.

### Phase 3 — Star Point (decisive point)
If a third deuce is reached, **a single point decides the game**. No more advantages. The returning team can choose which side to receive the serve.

> In short: two chances with advantage, and the third time's the charm.

## Where is it applied?

Since January 2026, the Star Point is used in:

- **Premier Padel** — The world's top professional circuit
- **CUPRA FIP Tour** — Second-tier professional circuit
- **FIP Promises** — FIP youth circuit
- **FIP Beyond** — Official amateur circuit

Its official debut was at the **FIP Bronze Melbourne** (January 5-11, 2026), and its first Premier Padel appearance was at the **Riyadh P1** (February 9-14).

## Why was it implemented?

The FIP designed the Star Point with three clear objectives:

1. **Reduce the length of tied games** — FIP simulations show the Star Point cuts average deuce duration by 40-50%.

2. **Protect player health** — Endless deuces (7, 8, 9 advantages) create cumulative physical strain during tournaments.

3. **Improve the TV experience** — More dynamic games with a clear climax (the Star Point) make matches more compelling for broadcasts.

## Star Point vs Golden Point vs Advantage: what's the difference?

| System | What happens at deuce (40-40) |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| **Classic Advantage** | Advantages are played indefinitely until one team wins two consecutive points |
| **Golden Point** | A single point decides the game immediately |
| **Star Point** | Two rounds of advantage + decisive point on the third |

The Star Point strikes the perfect balance: it preserves the tension of advantages while setting a limit so games are resolved in a reasonable timeframe.

## How does it affect your amateur game?

While the Star Point was born for the professional circuit, many clubs and amateur leagues are already adopting it. The reasons are the same as for the pros:

- **Shorter matches** — Perfect for 90-minute court bookings where time is tight
- **Less frustration** — No more endless 10-advantage deuces
- **More excitement** — The Star Point creates a climactic moment that raises the intensity

If you're thinking about trying it in your padel group, the transition is easy: you play exactly the same until 40-40, and only the deuce resolution changes.

## Try it in your next match

**Padel Tracker** already includes the Star Point as a format option. When setting up a match, you can choose between three deuce modes:

- **Golden Point** — The usual classic
- **Star Point** — The new FIP system
- **Advantage** — The traditional format

This way you can track your matches with the official system and see how it impacts your game stats.
