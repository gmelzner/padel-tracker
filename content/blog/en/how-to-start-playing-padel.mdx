Starting to play padel is easy — the court is small, the racket is short, and the ball bounces off the walls. But there's a huge difference between "playing" and "playing well." If you want to start on the right foot and surprise your friends, this guide is for you.

## The rules you need to know

You don't need to memorize the full rulebook. This is enough to get started:

- **It's always doubles** — 2 vs 2, no singles
- **Underhand serve** — The ball must bounce before you hit it, and it goes diagonally
- **Walls are part of the game** — The ball can bounce off any wall after the first bounce on the ground. This is what makes padel unique
- **Scoring is like tennis** — 15, 30, 40, game. 6 games to win a set
- **Golden point** — At 40-40, one deciding point is played (no advantage in most amateur tournaments)

## The 4 shots you need to master

Don't try to do everything on day one. Focus on these four:

### 1. The serve

The easiest shot in padel — and the one most people get wrong. The trick: **don't hit it hard**. A serve to the center with good direction is far more effective than a cannonball that goes out.

- Bounce the ball, let it rise to waist height
- Smooth swing, no excessive force
- Aim at the opponent's body or the center of the service box

### 2. The forehand (drive)

Your main shot. Prepare early by turning your shoulders, make contact in front of your body, and follow through. You don't need to hit hard — in padel, placement beats power.

### 3. The backhand

More important than you think, because many points are played on the backhand side. Continental grip, early preparation, and hit at hip height.

### 4. The volley

In padel, the net is where points are won. When you're at the net:

- Racket up, always ready
- Small adjustment steps
- Don't smash it — just redirect the ball

## 5 tactical tips to win from day one

### 1. Get to the net

Padel is won at the net. After every good shot, move forward. Staying at the back means letting your opponent control the point.

### 2. Play to the center

80% of your shots should go to the center of your opponents' court. Why? Because it forces both opponents to decide who takes it, causing confusion and errors.

### 3. Don't hit hard

The most common beginner mistake. In padel, the court is small and the walls return everything. If you hit hard, the ball bounces back and comes easy to your opponent. Better: soft shots with good direction.

### 4. Use the walls

When the ball goes to the wall, don't panic. Wait for the bounce and hit with composure. With practice, you'll start using rebounds to your advantage.

### 5. Communicate with your partner

"Mine," "yours," "leave it." Three words that change a match. Padel is a team sport — if you don't talk, you lose points to confusion.

## Track your progress

A concrete way to improve is to measure how you play. With [Padel Tracker](https://padeltracker.pro/tracker) you can log every match:

- How many points you win at the net vs from the back
- Your winners-to-unforced-errors ratio
- Whether you improve or decline set by set

Data shows you patterns that are invisible to the naked eye. And when you can see where you fail, you can practice with focus.
