Padel and pickleball are the two fastest-growing racquet sports in the world. Both are social, accessible, and addictive. But beyond that, they're very different games. If you're thinking about trying one — or both — this guide will help you understand what sets them apart.

## The court: walls vs open space

The most obvious difference is the court.

**Padel:** The court measures 20m x 10m (65ft x 33ft) and is fully enclosed by glass walls and metal mesh. The walls are part of the game — the ball can bounce off them and remain in play. This creates longer, more strategic points.

**Pickleball:** The court is smaller (13.4m x 6.1m / 44ft x 20ft, similar to badminton) and has no walls. There's a "no-volley zone" near the net called the "kitchen" where you can't smash.

> Padel is played *with* the walls. Pickleball is played *without* them.

## The equipment

### Racket/Paddle

**Padel:** The racket is solid, perforated with holes, and made of fiberglass or carbon fiber. It weighs between 340g and 385g. The shape (round, teardrop, diamond) affects the balance between control and power.

**Pickleball:** The paddle is lighter, flat, and looks like an oversized ping-pong paddle. It's made of composite, graphite, or wood. Much easier to handle from day one.

### Ball

**Padel:** Uses a ball similar to tennis but with less pressure. It bounces less and is slower, which favors long rallies.

**Pickleball:** Uses a plastic ball with holes (similar to a wiffle ball). It's very lightweight and doesn't bounce high, making the game more controlled.

## Main rules comparison

| Aspect | Padel | Pickleball |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Players** | Always doubles (2 vs 2) | Singles or doubles |
| **Serve** | Underhand, ball bounces first | Underhand, diagonal |
| **Walls** | Yes, part of the game | No walls |
| **Scoring** | Same as tennis (15-30-40) | First to 11, win by 2 |
| **Special zone** | None | "Kitchen" (no-volley zone) |

### The serve

In **padel**, the serve is underhand: you bounce the ball, let it rise, and hit it below waist height. It goes diagonally to the opponent's service box.

In **pickleball**, it's also underhand and diagonal, but the ball must clear the "kitchen" to be valid.

### The walls (padel only)

In padel, after the ball bounces on the ground, it can hit any wall and remain in play. This opens up unique tactical possibilities: you can let the ball bounce to get better positioning, or use the walls to return impossible shots.

### The "kitchen" (pickleball only)

In pickleball, there's a 7-foot zone from the net where you can't volley (hit the ball without letting it bounce). This prevents aggressive smashes and makes the game more about placement than power.

## Difficulty and learning curve

**Pickleball is easier to pick up.** The court is small, the ball is slow, and the rules are simple. In 15 minutes you can be playing and having fun. It's ideal for all ages and fitness levels.

**Padel has a steeper curve.** The walls add an extra dimension that takes time to master. You need to learn to read bounces, move around a bigger court, and develop specific shots. But once you get it, it's incredibly rewarding.

| Factor | Padel | Pickleball |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Time to play basic | 2-3 sessions | 15-30 minutes |
| Time to play well | 6-12 months | 2-3 months |
| Physical demand | Medium-high | Low-medium |
| Tactical complexity | High | Medium |

## Popularity: where is each played?

**Padel dominates in Europe and Latin America.** Spain, Argentina, Italy, and Sweden have the most courts. In 2026 there are over 70,000 padel courts worldwide and 35 million active players.

**Pickleball dominates in North America.** The United States and Canada are the main markets. In the USA it grew from 5 million players in 2021 to over 14 million in 2025.

Both sports are growing globally:
- Padel is exploding in the USA (from 20 courts in 2019 to over 650 in 2025)
- Pickleball is reaching Europe and Asia

## Which should you choose?

**Choose padel if:**
- You like strategic sports with long rallies
- You want a technical challenge that keeps you improving
- You prefer always playing doubles
- You live in an area with good padel court availability

**Choose pickleball if:**
- You want to start playing quickly without a steep learning curve
- You're looking for a low-impact sport
- You want the option to play singles or doubles
- You live in the USA or an area with more pickleball courts

**Why not both?** Many players practice both. Skills from one help in the other — reading the game, timing, patience during rallies.

## Conclusion

Padel and pickleball are different sports that share something key: they're social, accessible, and incredibly fun. Padel offers more tactical complexity and technical challenge. Pickleball offers immediate access and ease of play.

The best way to decide is to try both. Find a court nearby, gather some friends, and discover which one hooks you.
