Choosing a padel racket can be overwhelming. There are dozens of brands, models, materials, and shapes. But the reality is simpler than it seems: the shape of the racket is what impacts your game the most. Understand the three shapes and you'll be able to choose wisely.

## The 3 racket shapes

### Round — Control and comfort

The round racket has a wide, centered sweet spot, making it easier to hit the ball cleanly. The balance is low (near the handle), so it's less tiring on the arm and reduces the risk of wrist and elbow injuries.

**Who it's for:**
- Beginners who are learning the shots
- Defensive players who prioritize control
- Anyone who has had arm injuries

**Myth buster:** It's not just "for beginners." Many professionals use round rackets because they provide surgical precision on control shots.

### Teardrop — The perfect balance

The teardrop (or drop) shape is the middle ground between control and power. The sweet spot sits slightly higher than the round, giving it more punch without sacrificing too much control.

**Who it's for:**
- Intermediate players who already have technique
- Versatile players who attack and defend
- Anyone who wants one racket for everything

**It's the most popular shape on the circuit** and the best-selling worldwide. If you don't know what to pick, teardrop is the safe bet.

### Diamond — Maximum power

The diamond racket has a high balance (toward the tip), creating a brutal leverage effect on smashes. The sweet spot is smaller and sits higher, so you need good technique to take advantage of it.

**Who it's for:**
- Advanced players with solid technique
- Offensive players who thrive on smashes and aggressive volleys
- Those who know what they want and need extra power

**Caution:** If you're still developing your game, a diamond racket will amplify your errors. It's not the racket that makes you better — it's your technique.

## Quick summary

| Your level | Recommended shape | Why |
|------------|-------------------|-----|
| Beginner | Round | Large sweet spot, easy to handle, prevents injuries |
| Intermediate | Teardrop | Balance between control and power, versatile |
| Advanced | Diamond | Maximum power on smashes and volleys |

## Other factors that matter

### Weight

Rackets typically range from 340g to 385g. The general rule:

- **Under 360g** — More maneuverability, less fatigue. Good for beginners and players with arm problems
- **360g to 375g** — The standard range. Most intermediate players are here
- **Over 375g** — More power but more physically demanding

If you choose a diamond racket, consider going a few grams lighter than your usual weight, because the high balance makes it feel heavier.

### Material

- **Fiberglass** — More flexible, good for beginners. More affordable
- **Carbon** — More rigid, better response. For intermediate and advanced levels
- **Carbon + graphene/kevlar** — Maximum rigidity and durability. High-end rackets

### Core foam

- **EVA (soft)** — More control and comfort
- **FOAM** — More power and ball exit speed
- **HR EVA (high recovery)** — The current standard, good balance between both

## How to know if your current racket is right

This is where data helps. If you use [Padel Tracker](https://padeltracker.pro/tracker) to log your matches, you can see:

- **Too many unforced errors** → Your racket may be too powerful for your level. Drop to a shape with more control
- **Lack of winners** → You might need more power. Go up in shape or weight
- **Fatigue in the third set** → Your racket may be too heavy or have a balance that's too high

Numbers don't lie. Track several matches and you'll have concrete data to make your decision.

## Conclusion

There is no universal "best racket." There is the best racket **for you**, based on your level, your style, and your physique. Start with the shape, then adjust weight and material. And if in doubt, teardrop is always a good choice.
